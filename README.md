## Specs

The webpage allows the user to input a name for a more personalized order.

  -Output Example: Name on order: "Bob"

The webpage will calculate price of a pizza based on the size of a pizza.
  -Input Example: Pizza Size = Small
  -Output Example: Price = $8

The webpage will calculate price of a pizza based on the toppings on a pizza.
  -Input Example: Pizza Toppings = Mushrooms, Onions
  -Output Example: Pizza Toppings Price = $4

The webpage will take both the toppings and size the user selected and calculate total price.
  -Input Example: Pizza Size = Small; Pizza Toppings = Mushrooms, Onions
  -Output Example: Total Price = $12

The webpage allows entry for a delivery address if the user would like the pizza delivered and shows the final price, pizza ordered, name on the order, and delivery address when it displays the final order confirmation.
  -Input Example: (Name = Noah, Pizza Size = Small, Pizza Toppings = Ham, Pineapple, Address = 111 Example Street, Portland, OR)
  -Output Example: "Hi Noah, your small-sized pizza with Ham and Pineapple will come to a total of $12, and will be delivered to 111 Example Street, Portland, OR"
